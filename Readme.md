# FPM - Free Pascal Make

Yet another FPC make system.

FPM uses [TOML](http://toml.io) config files to build an FPC command line in a declarative syntax. You can use FPM with or instead of make or  batch files.

```toml
[variables]

  MY_UNITS = "./path/to"
  
[settings]

  configuration = "debug"

  unitPaths = [
    "${MY_UNITS}/units"
  ]
  includePaths = []
  libraryPaths = []
  symbols = []

  compiler = "/usr/local/lib/fpc/${LATEST}/${ARCH}"
  program = "./sources/FPM.pas"
  output = './output'
  executable = "./FPM"

  options = ["-vbr",
             "-WM10.10",
             "-XR${SDK}"
             ]

[configuration.debug]

  options = ["-gw", "-godwarfcpp", "-Sa"]

[configuration.release]

  options = ["-Xs", "-O2"]

```

üèÜ Features:

### How to install:

  `cd` into `/build` then do `make all install` which will install  `fpm` into `/usr/local/bin/fpm`

  Same as make files:
  Create a `fpconfig.toml` file in the directory of your project then `cd` to the directory and use `fpm`.

### ‚õì Dependencies:

 - Free Pascal Compiler 3.2 or higher
 - [fpTOML](https://github.com/genericptr/fpTOML)
